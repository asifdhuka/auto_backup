<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
This module needs the Python library pysftp, otherwise it cannot be installed and used. Install pysftp through the command <code>sudo pip install pysftp</code>

<h3>Version 8.0 or 9.0 or master?</h3>
Version 8.0 is the stable version for this module and build for Odoo V8, 9.0 is made for Odoo V9.
The version 8.0 of this module is tested and verified, 9.0 is still in progress / test. The master version is the development version.
The master version is still in testing and contains the newest features, which might still have problems/error.<br/>
<b>Tip:</b> At this point the master version is being rewritten to the new API and prepared for Odoo V10, please don't use this version at this point.<br/>
If you need to connect to a remote FTP server on another port than port 22 you should download and install the 9.0 or master version. Version 8 does not (yet) support another port than 22.
